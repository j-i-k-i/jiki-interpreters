# JavaScript Interpreter Evolution History

This document tracks the historical development and changes specific to the JavaScript interpreter.

## Comparison Operators Implementation (January 2025)

### Changes Made

Added full support for comparison and equality operators to the JavaScript interpreter:

**Operators Added**:

- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal)
- `<=` (less than or equal)
- `==` (equality with type coercion)
- `!=` (inequality with type coercion)

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Parser Updates** (`src/javascript/parser.ts`):
   - Added `comparison()` method between `addition()` and `equality()` in precedence chain
   - Added `equality()` method between `comparison()` and `logicalAnd()`
   - Proper operator precedence: multiplication → addition → comparison → equality → logical

2. **Executor Updates** (`src/javascript/executor/executeBinaryExpression.ts`):
   - Added cases for all comparison operators in `handleBinaryOperation()`
   - Added `verifyNumbersForComparison()` helper for type checking
   - Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) require numbers
   - Equality operators (`==`, `!=`) use JavaScript's type coercion

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added `ComparisonRequiresNumber` runtime error type
   - Comparison operators throw error when used with non-numbers
   - Error format: `"ComparisonRequiresNumber: operator: >: left: string"`

4. **Tests** (`tests/javascript/concepts/comparison.test.ts`):
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all operators
   - Tests for numbers (integers, decimals, negatives)
   - Tests for error cases with non-numbers
   - Tests for operator precedence and complex expressions
   - Tests for equality with type coercion

**Note**: Type coercion for comparison operators will be controlled by feature flags in future updates.

## Major Architecture Alignment (January 2025)

### Background

The JavaScript interpreter was extensively refactored to align with JikiScript's proven architecture patterns, ensuring consistent behavior and UI compatibility across all interpreters.

### Key Changes Made

**Before (Divergent Architecture)**:

- Complex `executeStatementsWithFrames()` function in interpreter
- Manual frame creation scattered throughout interpreter.ts
- Runtime errors returned as `{ error: RuntimeError }`
- Frame management mixed with execution logic
- Inconsistent error handling between parse and runtime errors

**After (Aligned Architecture)**:

- Clean separation: interpreter handles parsing, executor handles execution
- Frame management encapsulated within executor using `addFrame()` methods
- Runtime errors become error frames with `status: "ERROR"`
- Consistent `executeFrame()` wrapper pattern for all operations
- Parse errors as returned errors, runtime errors as frames

### Specific Implementation Changes

**1. Executor (`src/javascript/executor.ts`)**:

- Added `addFrame()`, `addSuccessFrame()`, `addErrorFrame()` methods
- Added `executeFrame()` wrapper for consistent frame generation
- Added `withExecutionContext()` for proper error boundaries
- Now always returns `error: null` (runtime errors become frames)

**2. Interpreter (`src/javascript/interpreter.ts`)**:

- Simplified to single `interpret()` function
- Removed complex `executeStatementsWithFrames()`
- Only handles parse errors as returned errors
- Clean separation between compile and execute phases

**3. Parser (`src/javascript/parser.ts`)**:

- Fixed `consumeSemicolon()` to return token for location tracking
- Fixed ExpressionStatement location to include semicolon in span
- Improved statement location accuracy for error reporting

**4. Tests**:

- Updated error tests to expect error frames instead of returned errors
- Added system language configuration for consistent error messages
- Fixed test expectations to match new error handling pattern

### Impact of Changes

- **Consistency**: JavaScript now matches JikiScript's proven architecture exactly
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, easier to extend
- **Testability**: 313 tests passing with improved error handling
- **UI Compatibility**: Proper frame generation ensures UI integration works correctly

## Object System Evolution

### January 2025: File Standardization

- **File Rename**: `jsObjects.ts` → `jikiObjects.ts` for consistency across all interpreters
- **Field Standardization**: Removed duplicate `jsObject` field from `EvaluationResult`, kept only standardized `jikiObject` field

**Before (Duplicate Fields)**:

```typescript
type EvaluationResult = {
  type: string;
  jikiObject: JikiObject;
  jsObject: JikiObject; // ❌ Duplicate field - removed
};
```

**After (Standardized)**:

```typescript
type EvaluationResult = {
  type: string;
  jikiObject: JikiObject; // ✅ Single, consistent field
};
```

### Benefits Achieved

- Eliminated confusion about which field to use
- Consistent with JikiScript and Python interpreters
- Simplified cross-interpreter functionality maintenance

## Language Features Implementation

### Progressive Development

JavaScript interpreter supports configurable language features for educational purposes:

**allowShadowing Feature**:

- Controls whether variables in inner scopes can shadow outer variables
- When `false`: Runtime error "ShadowingDisabled" for shadowing attempts
- When `true`: Normal JavaScript shadowing behavior
- Educational benefit: Helps students understand scoping without confusion

### Implementation Timeline

- Basic expressions and operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- Variable declarations with `let` keyword
- Block statements with lexical scoping
- If/else statement support with comprehensive testing
- Variable assignment operations with scope validation

## Test Coverage Evolution

### Current Test Status

- **313 tests passing** covering comprehensive functionality
- **Syntax Error Tests**: Comprehensive error coverage for invalid syntax
- **Runtime Error Tests**: Variable scoping, type operations, and validation
- **Concept Tests**: Feature-specific testing for variables, blocks, arithmetic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end interpretation validation

### Testing Patterns Established

- System language configuration for error message consistency
- Frame-based error validation following shared architecture
- Modular test organization matching executor architecture

## Error System Development

### Error Type Coverage

- **13 Syntax Error types**: Basic parsing and lexical errors
- **4 Runtime Error types**: Variable access, type operations, unsupported features
- Consistent system message format: `"ErrorType: context: {{variable}}"`

### Translation System

- Self-contained translation system with system/en language support
- Educational error messages tailored to JavaScript syntax
- Independent from other interpreters while following shared conventions

## Modular Architecture Implementation

### Executor Pattern

JavaScript follows the established modular executor pattern:

- Individual executor modules for each AST node type
- Consistent interface: `(executor: Executor, node: ASTNode) → EvaluationResult`
- Easy extensibility for new JavaScript features
- Clear separation between execution logic and frame management

### Current Executor Coverage

**Expression Executors**:

- Literal, Binary, Unary, Grouping, Identifier, Assignment expressions

**Statement Executors**:

- Expression statements, Variable declarations, Block statements, If statements

## Historical Context

### Why JavaScript Alignment Was Necessary

- **UI Compatibility**: Ensure consistent frame generation across all interpreters
- **Maintainability**: Eliminate architectural divergence that made maintenance difficult
- **Educational Consistency**: Provide uniform learning experience
- **Testing Reliability**: Establish consistent error handling patterns

### Lessons from Refactoring

- Early alignment prevents architectural divergence
- Consistent error handling is critical for UI integration
- Test coverage must be maintained during refactoring
- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability

### Current Status

JavaScript interpreter now serves as a reference implementation alongside JikiScript:

- Follows shared architecture patterns exactly
- Maintains JavaScript-specific functionality while ensuring cross-interpreter consistency
- Provides educational JavaScript experience with frame-by-frame visualization
- Supports progressive language learning with configurable features

This evolution establishes JavaScript as a core component of the Jiki educational ecosystem with full architectural consistency.
