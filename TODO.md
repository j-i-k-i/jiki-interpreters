- [ ] Add variables to JavaScript. Reference the JikiScript implementation to see how things should be set up. For now, don't worry about scoping, etc. We'll add that next. Just implement `let`. Don't implement `const` or `var`. Make sure to add corrosponding parser and implementer concept tests. Also add syntax error tests. Look at the JikiScript tests for inspiration.
- [ ] Add a block with scope to JavaScript. A variable defined via let in this scope should only exist inside the scope. For now, don't worry about shadowing. Remember to add concept tests and syntax error tests (e.g. an unclosing block). Look at the JikiScript tests for inspiration.
- [ ] Add a new language feature to JavaScript interpreter for allow_shadowing. See language features for JikiScript to see how this works. If the feature is enabled, then inner variables can be created by let inside blocks to shadow outer variables. If it is false, then any attempt to shadow with let should result in a shadowing disabled runtime error. Remember to add tests for both cases.
- [ ] Add a language feature to the JavaScript interpreter for truthiness. See language features for JikiScript to see how this works.
